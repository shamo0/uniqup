A Python script that takes in a file of URLs, modifies their parameters, and writes unique modified URLs to an output file.

## Description

Uniqup is a Python script that reads in a file of URLs, modifies their parameters, and writes unique modified URLs to an output file. This script can be used with tools like `gau` and `gauplus` to ensure that only unique URLs are kept. The modified URLs are created by replacing the values of each query parameter with a new value in the format `paramN`, where `N` is an integer starting from 1. The modified URLs are then sorted and duplicates are removed to produce the final output file.

<br><br>
If you get URLs such as these from wayback or gau, you can run this python script on the url file to get rid of the repeated parameters with different values.

You will be left with these types of URLS with unique parameters eventually saving you time on testing your injection payloads :)
